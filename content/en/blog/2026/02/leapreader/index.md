**LeapReader** is an AI-powered Chrome extension that helps you read, understand, and extract insights from web content more efficiently.

Whether you're conducting academic research, staying current with industry developments, or simply learning faster, LeapReader streamlines your digital reading experience.


## Core Capabilities

### Intelligent Summarization

Instantly condense lengthy articles, research papers, and web pages into clear, actionable summaries.
LeapReader integrates multiple AI models — including **Gemini**, **DeepSeek**, and **Doubao** — to deliver high-quality results.


### Video Intelligence

Generate summaries for **YouTube** and **Bilibili** videos with segment breakdowns and timestamp navigation, allowing you to jump directly to relevant content.


### Smart Extraction

Quickly identify and extract key information, quotes, and insights for notes or research documentation.


### Persistent Memory

If enabled, user messages are stored in **MemMachine** and can be used in future conversations.


## Built for Complicated Workflows

For students and researchers, LeapReader addresses a critical challenge: managing information across dozens of sources over extended timeframes.

Traditional approaches often involve:

- Opening multiple tabs  
- Manually copying quotes  
- Losing track of reviewed sources  

With LeapReader:

- Instantly summarize papers as you browse  
- Save important quotes or insights into memory  
- Maintain context across multiple documents  

When writing, you can recall saved quotes and summaries without searching through tabs or files.

This creates a seamless **research-to-writing pipeline** that maintains continuity throughout your project.


## Powered by MemMachine

LeapReader’s persistent capabilities are powered by **MemMachine**, an open-source memory layer that provides true continuity across browsing sessions.

Unlike traditional AI tools that treat each interaction in isolation, MemMachine retains your research context over time through dual memory systems:

- **Episodic Memory** — saves browsing history and extracted content  
- **Profile Memory** — learns your reading patterns and preferences  

This architecture transforms LeapReader from a simple summarization tool into an intelligent research assistant that evolves with your needs.

The system is model-agnostic, supporting major LLMs while keeping your data under your control through on-premises or private cloud deployment options.


## Privacy and Accessibility

LeapReader operates primarily within your browser, transmitting content to AI providers only when you explicitly request assistance.

Your reading history and research data remain private and secure.

The intuitive side panel and context menu interface provide powerful capabilities without cluttering your workspace.


## Get Started

LeapReader is available through the Chrome Web Store. Install the extension and begin reading smarter immediately — no complex setup required.
